        <p className="mb-4">
          Inspired by the phrase "Buy me a coffee", we chose chai because it's something that connects deeply with our culture. A small donation ‚Äî the cost of a cup of chai ‚Äî can go a long way in showing appreciation and supporting someone's journey.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We keep things minimal, fast, and personal. Just share your profile, receive funds directly, and keep doing what you love. No middlemen. No complications.
