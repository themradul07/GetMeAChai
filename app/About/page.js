        <p className="mb-4">
          Inspired by the phrase &quot;Buy me a coffee&quot;, we chose chai because it&apos;s something that connects deeply with our culture. A small donation ‚Äî the cost of a cup of chai ‚Äî can go a long way in showing appreciation and supporting someone&apos;s journey.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We keep things minimal, fast, and personal. Just share your profile, receive funds directly, and keep doing what you love. No middlemen. No complications.
